## :page_facing_up: **Abstract:**  
Accurate forecasting of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) constitutes a key step in field evaluation and optimization during hydraulic fracturing. In this work, a data-driven model is developed to take advantage of field monitored microseismicity and fracturing parameters for predicting SRV ahead of time. A voxelized method is applied to calculate SRV values using recorded microseismicity data. Fracturing parameters along with SRV history are fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as inputs. This model can successfully characterize the evolution of SRV. The LSTM network has excellent prediction accuracy (R2 > 0.80) at most stages while performing poorly at the initial stages. The influence of SRV history, time lag size and time window length is investigated to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study provides a new approach for unconventional reservoir hydraulic fracturing assessment using data-driven methods.
